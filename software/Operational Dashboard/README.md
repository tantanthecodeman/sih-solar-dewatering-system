## ðŸš€ Quick Start

1. **Extract the folder.**
2. Open `src/App.jsx` and replace `<YOUR_PC_IP>` with your **machine IP** where Node-RED is running:
   ```js
   const WS_URL = "ws://<Your IP Address>:1880/mqtt"
   const API_URL = "http://<Your IP Address>:5000/api/status"
3. **Install dependencies:**
```bash
npm install
```
4. **Run dev server:**
```bash
npm run dev
```
4. **Run dev server:**
Open URL printed by Vite (e.g. http://localhost:5173
) in your browser.

## ðŸ”Œ Node-RED WebSocket Bridge

A sample Node-RED flow JSON (`node-red-flow.json`) is included.  
It creates a **WebSocket endpoint** `/mqtt` that bridges messages between your React frontend and a real MQTT broker.

- **Frontend connects to:**  
ws://<NODE_RED_IP>:1880/mqtt
- **Message forwarding:**  
- `mine/sensors` â†’ **broker â†’ frontend**  
- **WebSocket pump control messages** â†’ broker topic `mine/pump/control`
### ðŸš€ Import Flow
1. Open Node-RED  
2. Click **Menu â†’ Import â†’ Clipboard**  
3. Paste the JSON from `solar_flow.json`  
4. Deploy the flow âœ…
